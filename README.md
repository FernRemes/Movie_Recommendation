# Movie Recommendations
Using a dataset we can make a program that is able to analyze the user's input and use match pattern to able to  categorize possible options that are similar to those of the user's input.

For instance, in this program the user inputs their favourite movie and the program will give suggestions of other movies to recommend to watch.
